      When new AI models are released, it is customary to include a "model card" or "system card" that describes the model's capabilities, how the model was trained, how the model was tested for safety, and any unique risks that the model may present. Publishing a robust and honest model card is an important act of transparency, even if it highlights alarming risks or limitations.


      These documents can get technical, but they are usually pretty accessible and contain important information. Journalists can find fascinating details in a model card, and when a new model drops, it's always worth a read.
