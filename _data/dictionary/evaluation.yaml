      A standardized test used to measure how well an AI model performs on specific tasks. Researchers and AI companies run evaluations — often called "evals" — to compare models on everything from reading comprehension and math to coding and common-sense reasoning, similar to how standardized tests are used to compare students or schools.


      For data reporters, evals matter in two practical ways. First, they're the main evidence AI companies cite when claiming their newest model is smarter or safer than the last one — so understanding what a given eval actually measures (and what it doesn't) is essential for covering AI progress critically. Second, safety evaluations are used to test for dangerous capabilities before a model is released to the public, including whether a model could help someone synthesize a biological weapon or autonomously hack into critical infrastructure. A reporter covering AI policy, biosecurity, or tech regulation will encounter evals constantly.


      Evals have also become a flashpoint in debates about AI transparency. Critics argue that companies cherry-pick which tests to publish, that many benchmarks have significant methodological flaws, and that models can be inadvertently trained to score well on a test without actually improving at the underlying skill — a problem sometimes called "benchmark contamination."
