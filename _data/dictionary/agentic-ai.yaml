      AI systems designed to take actions on a user's behalf over many steps, not just answer questions. An agentic system can make a plan, use tools (like a browser or code), check its work, and keep going until it reaches a goal.


      For data reporters and newsroom developers, agentic AI matters because it shifts generative AI from "drafting" to "doing." In practice, that could look like an agent that monitors a government site for new PDFs, downloads and names files consistently, extracts tables into a dataset, and flags changes for a human to review. It can also chain together workflow steps that are tedious but important, like cleaning messy spreadsheets, reconciling records across sources, and producing a repeatable report.


      The upside is speed and automation. The downside is risk: when an AI can take actions, mistakes have consequences. Guardrails like least-privilege tool access, approval checkpoints (see [plan mode](/plan-mode/)), and defenses against [prompt injection](/prompt-injection/) become critical. Related concepts include [agent skills](/agent-skills/), [subagents](/subagents/), [Model Context Protocol](/model-context-protocol/), and [the lethal trifecta](/the-lethal-trifecta/).
